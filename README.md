# RLOX

This Rust project is an attempt to create the Lox scripting language, as described here:

[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

The Crafting Interpreters book by Robert Nystrom, is available in full at that site.

I'm trying this in Rust despite the sample code in the book is written first in Java, and then in C.

I'm doing this to learn Rust, and also to learn about compilers.
